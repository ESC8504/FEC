# After fork and clone the repo:
1)git remote add upstream <URL>
to keep the fork synchronized with the Omega-outlet main repo.
2) git checkout -b feature/XXX
to create a "feature" branch to keep it away from the main branch, which keeps the work isolated and organized.
3) Coding....
4) git pull upstream main (make regular updates like toy problem to keep  local copy up to date.)
5) git push origin feature/XXX   to Push the feature branch to your fork on GitHub.
6) Create a Pull Request
7) ***Review and Merge: Before every merge I think at least one group member other than the one who made the pull request should review the pull request, possibly requesting changes. Once approved, the changes can be merged into the main branch of the organization repository.
